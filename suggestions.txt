Forking a repository means copying an existing repository under your own
account. This will allow you to make changes to the upstream repository
without messing up the original versions. The changes are made under your
account. Pulling allows you to change the repository for what you have. It
is also possible to do a pull request which will allow your changes made
under your own version of the repository be made to the upstream repository.
